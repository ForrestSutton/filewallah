Instead of cluttering the root of the project, I prefer to put my RequestHandler
and Model subclasses into modules and packages. In practice,
 I follow a very POSIX-inspired project layout with an app/ folder that contains
  all the code that I'm going to send to GAE:

app/
app.yaml
dispatch.py
lib --> ../lib/python2.7/site-packages/ (generated by pip install)
bin/
etc/
requirements.txt (generated by pip freeze)
lib/
python2.7/site-packages/ (generated by pip install <package>)
var/
